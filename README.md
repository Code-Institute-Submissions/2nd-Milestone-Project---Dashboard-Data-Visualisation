## Second Milestone Project (still currently under Development)
*(some comments below taken from Code Institute lessons).*

- BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE PROJECT:

This is my second Milestone Project for Full-Stack Diploma in Software Development. The project is a data dashboard, which visualizes (of my choice).  The dataset is stored locally, as opposed to being stored in an API. The data is visualised using D3.js and dc.js.

- WHAT IS D3.JS? 

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS.  SVG is Scalable Vector Graphics and is a standardised graphics rendering format based on XML. Creation of 2D graphics called Vector Graphics. Vector Graphics can be increased or decreased in size without loss of clarity. Use D3 to create anything from an HTML table to a Pie chart, from graphs and bar charts to geospatial maps.

D3 is a set of objects functions that comes in the form of a third-party JavaScript file written by Mike Bostock which you can use ( <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.17/d3.min.js"></script>), which is just like any external javascript file in the script tag and we've included here. D3 creates SVG's similar to what we created in earlier, plus a lot more but it does it programmatically rather than markup one of the things d3 relies on is attaching itself to some HTML element such as a div for example.
